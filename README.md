# Project: Grayscale Image Processing from Hex Input

This project processes **hexadecimal image data** and converts it into a **grayscale format** using Rust.

## How It Works:

### 1. Hexadecimal Image Processing (`process_hex_image`)

- The function `process_hex_image` takes a **hexadecimal string (as a pointer)** and its **length**.
- It **validates the input**, extracts the hex data, and converts it into a `Vec<u8>` byte array.
- The processed data is then passed to the **grayscale conversion function**.

### 2. RGB to Grayscale Conversion (`rgb_to_grayscale`)

- This function takes **RGB pixel data** and converts it into a **grayscale image**.

- It applies the **luminance formula**:

  ```plaintext
  gray = (R * 0.299) + (G * 0.587) + (B * 0.114)
  ```

  - Where **R, G, B** are the red, green, and blue color intensities, respectively.
  - The coefficients **0.299, 0.587, and 0.114** represent the **relative luminance weight** of each color channel, based on human eye sensitivity.
  - The formula converts the weighted sum of the color intensities into a **single grayscale value**.

- It iterates through the **RGB data in chunks of 3 bytes (R, G, B)** and computes the grayscale intensity.

- The resulting grayscale values are stored in a `Vec<u8>`.

### 3. Default Image Size

- The grayscale image is assumed to have a fixed **width and height of 100x100 pixels**.

## Test Case

### Input (Fully Red Image - 3x3 Example)

A **fully red image** means every pixel in the image has the RGB values:

```plaintext
(R, G, B) = (255, 0, 0)
```

Each pixel will be converted to grayscale using the formula:

```plaintext
Gray = (R * 0.299) + (G * 0.587) + (B * 0.114)
```

Substituting the values:

```plaintext
Gray = (255 * 0.299) + (0 * 0.587) + (0 * 0.114)
Gray = 76.245 â‰ˆ 76
```

#### **Input (RGB Values):**

```plaintext
[
  255, 0, 0,   255, 0, 0,   255, 0, 0,
  255, 0, 0,   255, 0, 0,   255, 0, 0,
  255, 0, 0,   255, 0, 0,   255, 0, 0
]
```

#### **Expected Output (Grayscale Values):**

```plaintext
[
  76, 76, 76,
  76, 76, 76,
  76, 76, 76
]
```

This confirms that a fully red image is converted to a **dark gray shade with intensity 76 for all pixels**.
